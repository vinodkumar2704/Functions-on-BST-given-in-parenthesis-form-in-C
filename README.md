# Functions-on-BST-given-in-parenthesis-form-in-C
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) T in Parenthesis Representation. A program that implements the following functions:

• Predecessor(T, k) - Searches for a node with key k in T, and returns a pointer to a node
which is predecessor of the node with key k if one exists; otherwise, it returns NIL.
• Successor(T, k) - Searches for a node with key k in T, and returns a pointer to a node which
is successor of the node with key k if one exists; otherwise, it returns NIL.
• Inorder(T) - Performs recursive inorder traversal of the BST T and prints the data in the
nodes of T in inorder.
• Klargest(T, k)- Returns the K-th largest value in the BST T.
• Ksmallest(T, k)- Returns the K-th smallest value in the BST T.
